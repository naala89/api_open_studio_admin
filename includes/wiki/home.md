Welcome to ApiOpenStudio
========================

Thank you for downloading ApiOpenStudio, and welcome to a great open-source API community!

ApiOpenStudio allows you to define API's using only YAML or JSON.

Unlike other API's, ApiOpenStudio allows you to define logic and processing of data without any coding.

At a base level, programming can be reduced to semantic block, like 'for each', "while", "do this", "do that", etc.
ApiOpenStudio allows you to define the flow of data through these semantic blocks, using a resource file, written in YAML or JSON.
